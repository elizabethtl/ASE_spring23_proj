\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Machine learning is an area with fast-growing research, with broad applications
ranging from image processing to chatbots such as chatGPT. Machine
learning classifiers rely on data to extract heuristics and patterns.
Classical machine learning is mostly supervised learning, where the data
is labeled. However, in real-world scenarios, it can be costly to label
all data, hence the use of semi-supervised learning. Our approach is
based off of the sway method proposed by Chen et
al~\cite{chen2018sampling}. 

In our report, we describe how we extended sway, and what datasets and
experiments were conducted. Section \ref{sec:method} discusses our
modified approach of sway and the
datasets we used. Section \ref{sec:results} provides results and
insight we gained from our experiments.
