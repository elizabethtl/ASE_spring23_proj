\section{Bonus: Requirements Study}
\label{sec:bonus_requirements}

For our requirements study, we collected five reqgrids with a common
theme of TV shows. We asked the participants to come up with TV shows
and characteristics and rate the shows based on them. An example of the
output for clustering the TV shows can be seen in listing
\ref{lst:grid}. The outputs of each grid can be found in the GitHub
repository. A common characteristic
many people came up with was whether the show was easy to watch or full
of suspense. From the results, we observe that this was often also the
most significant feature that separated shows. We could infer that the
story and tone of the show could have a great influence on viewers'
rating of the show. Other less significant feature included whether the
show was realistic, episode length, connection to previous seasons, etc.
We might conclude from the results that these characteristics have less
of an effect on how the audience rates the show.
