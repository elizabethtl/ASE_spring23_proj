\section{Bonus: February Study}
\label{sec:bonus_february}

For our february study, we take a look back at our results for xpln. As
xpln picks a rule to best distinguish between the best and rest data
returned by sway. We could make use of results and rules from a previous
study to help in future studies. Xpln performs better than sway in
certain datasets, which we highlighted in blue in the tables. 
If we were to minimize risk in the dataset
\textit{coc10000}, we could filter data first according to the rule
given by xpln. In one of our runs of experiments on \textit{coc10000},
the rule \verb|{data ['n']}| chosen by xpln yielded better results than
sway. For future studies, we could collect a set of rules that xpln
performs better on, and preprocess the data using those rules to get
better results.
