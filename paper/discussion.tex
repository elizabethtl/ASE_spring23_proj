  As sway is the current state-of-the-art method, we spent the majority
  of our time unpacking and understanding sway. We did not want to
  completely reinvent the wheel, thus our new method builds on top of
  it. Future work can be done on further extending and making changes to
  sway to achieve better performance.

  \subsection{Threats to validity}
    Our method was based off of sway, we were given sample code of sway
    and had to implement it in our own code. While we made the best effort
    to implement it, there might be small details where we missed or
    misunderstood. This could result in our experiments and results being
    slightly inaccurate.
