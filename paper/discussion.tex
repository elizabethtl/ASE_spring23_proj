\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

  As sway is the current state-of-the-art method, we spent the majority
  of our time unpacking and understanding sway. We did not want to
  completely reinvent the wheel, thus our new method builds on top of
  it. Future work can be done on further extending and fine-tuning to
  sway to achieve better performance.

  We would want to further explore how sample size in sway effects the
  results. Our current results do not show a positive correlation
  between the objectives and sample size, which is contrary to our
  intuition. As discussed in section \ref{ssec:sample_size}, we belive
  the current implementation does not take full use of different sample
  sizes. For future work, we would like to modify this so that results
  are in line with the sampling tax assumption.

  \subsection{Threats to validity}
    Our method was based off of sway, we were given sample code of sway
    and had to implement it in our own code. While we made the best effort
    to implement it, there might be small details where we missed or
    misunderstood. This could result in our experiments and results being
    slightly inaccurate.
