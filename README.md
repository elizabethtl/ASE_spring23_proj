source code is in [/src](./src/)

datasets in [/data](./data/)

experiments output in [/etc](./etc/)

tables of results we did not include in the report is in [tables](./etc/tables/)

-----

this is the final project for automated software engineering

we made modifications to sway in an attempt to yield better results

the original sway code is in [sway1](./src/sway1/)

the modified sway code is in [sway2](./src/sway2)

then 

applied sway1 to xpln -> [xpln1](./src/xpln1/)

applied sway2 to xpln -> [xpln2](./src/xpln2)

----

bonus parts we implemented

a repgrid experiment on TV shows -> [repgrid](./src/repgrid)

an ablation study on the auto2 dataset -> [ablation](./src/ablation/)
